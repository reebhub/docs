# Time Series Rollup 
---

{NOTE: }

* Time series **Rollup** allows you to represent a large data set by a smaller 
  one, and use it for quick queries when the complete data set is not required.  
  
    You can, for example, represent a long set of heartbeats data with a rollup set 
  that represents each hour of heartbeats by a single entry, containing the average 
  heartrate during this hour.
