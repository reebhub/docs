###Time Series and Revisions  

A [document revision](../../../client-api/session/revisions/what-are-revisions) stores all the document's time series' names, 
but only selected timepoints [start and end timeponits?]  
 
* **Stored Time Series Values**  
  [specify how values are stored here]  

* Revisions-creation can be initiated by time series **name** modification.  
   * When the Revisions feature is enabled, the creation or deletion of a time series initiates the creation of a new document revision.  
   * Time series **value** modifications do **not** cause the creation of new revisions.
